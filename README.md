Welcome to my TicTacToe game! 

This would be a machine learning Tic Tac Toe game which would read from the MongoDb Database to determine how to win. 

I am presently in the process of training the AI and collecting some game data. 

You can run the board.html file and initate a game. However, the AI would only be dropping random moves for now. This game data would be used for training AI in the future. 


Overview:

Board.html - This will be the html page with some jquery and javascript.

Style.css - This is the styling for the page. I have used css flexbox as well.

config- database.js - Connection string for Mongodb

Model Folder(

game.js - This is where mongoose will be talking to MongoDb cloud. This will keep track of who wins and who loses and would save it in my MongoDB MLab account.

Winner.js - This will track whether the player has won or lost depending on the moves. 

AI.js - This would be the bayesian algorithm which the computer would be using in the future to determine its next move.

Thanks for dropping by here! Appreciate your time!
